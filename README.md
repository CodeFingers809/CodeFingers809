Hi I am Ayush Bohra and I am the person who runs the Code Fingers youtube channel
I use this account to share all the code from my
youtube tutorial so that everyone can have it.

I have been doing javascript programming since a long time now.
My youtube channel focuses on making short tutorials for beginners
in javascript to become better at it faster.

My channel features several projects which they can build themselves
in the learning phase of their journey.

Something about me now...
I am just a normal guy who loves to code.
I have learnt a few languages but javascript is the one I
really like. It is simple and easy and offers great things
at the same time.
I am just 17 years old right now but have been coding since
2 years. It is not much but I still think I fairly good.

I think this is it for my intro.
If you wanna see my youtube channel go to Code Fingers on youtube
