Hi! I am Ayush Bohra 🧑.
I am from Mumbai, India 📍.
I am a 18yo teenager extremely interested in Web Design 🌐.
I've been working on small interactive sites and projects to improve my Web Development skills day-by-day 🌇.
I think I've found my kick in Web Development and I really like the decision I made by choosing this field 📚.
I've got a lot of things to learn ahead of me but that's not gonna stop me from becoming the best 💎.
